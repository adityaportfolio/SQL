- Joins, filtering, grouping, sorting
- Real-world datasets (Superstore, E-commerce, COVID-19, etc.)

## 💼 About Me
I'm a data enthusiast with a background in management and a strong interest in data analytics. I enjoy uncovering insights from raw data and turning them into meaningful stories that support better decision-making. I'm currently building my data portfolio and continuously learning through hands-on projects.
