#In this project, I used SQL to extract information on products and their prices from the Superstore database

#Execute a SELECT query to sort the items based on their price
SELECT item_id, item_name, category, price
FROM superstore
ORDER BY price DESC;

#Display a statistical summary of the item prices
SELECT COUNT(price), SUM(price), MAX(price), MIN(price), AVG(price)
FROM superstore;

#Display a price-related statistic for items classified under 'Kitchen Supplies'
SELECT COUNT(price), SUM(price), MAX(price), MIN(price), AVG(price)
FROM superstore
WHERE category='Kitchen Supplies';

#shows information about items in the 'Kitchen Supplies' category that have an average rating above 4.5
SELECT item_id, item_name, category, price, stock_quantity, average_rating
FROM superstore
WHERE average_rating >4.5 AND category='Kitchen Supplies'
ORDER BY average_rating DESC;

#Presents information on 'Furnishings' products that have received an average rating above 4.5
SELECT item_id, item_name, category, price, stock_quantity, average_rating
FROM superstore
WHERE average_rating >4.5 AND category='Furnishings'
ORDER BY average_rating DESC;

#Provides data on items from the 'Appliances' category that are rated above 4.5
SELECT item_id, item_name, category, price, stock_quantity, average_rating
